# UFOs

## Overview

We used JavaScript and HTML to create a website that allows users to view and find UFO sighting reports. We created a filter using Javascript arrays that allow the user to search by date, city, state, country, and shape of the sighting.

## Results

### Unfiltered

This is the unfiltered page. Users can see the aforementioned data with all the sightings reported in the table.

### Filtered

By inputting a search paramater in any of the fields (in this case benton), the webpage will update to show only the filtered results.

## Summary

One drawback is the search parameter is case sensitive. This means someone searching for Benton or OR wil result in a blank page when there shouldn't be. One suggestion for improvement would be to find a way to remove the case sensitivity. Another suggestion would be to allow the search of date ranges instead of a single date.
